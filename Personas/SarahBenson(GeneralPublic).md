### Activities:
- John enjoys watching Netflix, getting food with friends, browsing social media, and going to the beach on hot days
- In Sarah's spare time she enjoys using mobile devices. While she does own a laptop, she rarely uses it and instead frequents her phone.

### Aptitudes:
- Sarah is quite artistic and can do a wide array of tasks to a slightly above-average skill level

### Weaknesses:
- Sarah struggles to understand complex topics and simply has no real interest in doing so anyway. She works in retail and doesn't have the need or desire to mentally challenge herself

### Motivations:
- Sarah would be interested in COVID-19 visualisations to be able to make small talk with family and customers at her work. 
- She has no real need for COVID-19 information, however, is generally interested in order to have a rough idea of what is happening in the world

### Computer Self-Efficacy:
- Sarah has next to no idea how computers and technology works in general. She uses text editing software and web browsers but absolutely nothing more, and struggles when any deviations arise.
- Sarah has a fast typing speed and can operate mobile devices with absolute ease

### Information Processing Style:
- Sarah likes to learn organically without having information forced on her
- Anything with visual elements and colour draws her attention and helps her focus, as big blocks of text are intimidating and boring to her
