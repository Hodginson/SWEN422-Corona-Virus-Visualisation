### Activities:
- John enjoys writing, golf, cooking, and spending time with his family

- John is not good at anything mathematical and doesn't like to do any sums or calculations in his head

### Motivations:
- John wants to use a COVID-19 information visualiser to quickly and easily see the trends in historical covid data in his country (Canada)
- John would like to compare various statistics over multiple countries and regions such that he can write his news articles

### Computer Self-Efficacy:
- John has enough computer knowledge to be able to use Microsoft office software and web browsers but not much more
- He is able to install new software and manually look through data files and CSVs, however, it takes him a long time and he often struggles

### Information Processing Style:
- John likes to be told what to do in complicated scenarios
- John always reads through instruction manuals and struggles to understand concepts if they are absent from any documentation or external resources
